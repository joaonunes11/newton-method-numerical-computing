# Newton's Method – Numerical Computing (Computação Numérica)

This project was developed as part of the e-fólio A for the course *Computação Numérica (21180)* at Universidade Aberta. It consists of analyzing and solving a nonlinear equation using symbolic and numerical methods, with emphasis on the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

## 🧮 Project Overview

- Plotting a function and its first and second derivatives.
- Implementing the Newton-Raphson method.
- Applying the method to two distinct initial values.
- Visualizing convergence behavior and results.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB or Octave.
2. Run `efa1.m` to visualize the function and its derivatives.
3. Run `efa2.m` to execute Newton’s method on the given cases.

```matlab
